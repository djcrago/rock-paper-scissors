        <h1>Rock, Paper, Scissors... from the console!</h1>
        <h2>To play, follow the below instructions.</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Press command + option + j. This opens up the "console" where you will play the game.
            </li>
            <li style="width:600px">
                Press the button below. You will be prompted to answer the question, "Rock, Paper, or Scissors?" Each prompt is a new round with the computer. A full game is best of 5, where ties don't count (so you may type in more than five choices).
            </li>
            <li>
                That's it! The console will display final scores and whether you won or lost!
