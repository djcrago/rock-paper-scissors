This project contains a website with a rock, paper, scissors game in the console.

I learned a lot and cemented a lot of the javascript knowledge I've gained up to this point.

Things I practiced and learned how to do include:
- Employing problem solving strategies
- Starting with pen and paper algorithm writing
- Selecting a value randomly
- Declaring, creating, and passing arguments to functions
- Nesting functions and if statements
- Using a for loop and incrementing variables
- Concatenating and embeding variables into strings using backticks
- Creating a usable button
- Fixing bugs, optimizing code efficiency, and improving user experience
- Refactoring code
- Using arrays, for...of loops, the array.map() method
- DOM manipulation and events
- Making a simple, dynamic browser game

I could have gone in different directions a few times. I tried to always go with the route that involved the least amount of repetition and most amount of automation.

I'm sure in the future I will learn strategies that could generate the same result with fewer lines of code. I will probably also learn how to generate a better result than what I have. However, today I am very pleased with what I have made. I wrote it all in a single day. I worked non-stop for about six hours.
